The implementation is re-designed to follow a strict MVC pattern - seperating graphics, logic and input handling. This implementation is intended to serve as a base structure for larger games - therefore it resulted in more code and classes in comparison to Brents original solution. For example: two seperate classes were implemented for sound and input handling though they are redundant for such a small game as this.

Since im rather new to Java and libGDX in particular - any feedback about the code or designpattern is appreciated.
