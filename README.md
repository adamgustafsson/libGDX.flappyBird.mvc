# libGDX_FlappyBird_mvc
Redesign of Brent Aureli's libGDX - FlappyBird tutorial.
https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCO9JvZ75Usyzgd1puurLF6A

The implementation is re-designed to follow a strict MVC pattern - seperating graphics, logic and input handling.

Since im rather new to Java and libGDX in particular - any feedback about the code or designpattern is appreciated.
